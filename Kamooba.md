# Example Code

Below is the example code on how Kamooba works in operation. 


Declare class main {
  Static main Kaargs {

Str message = “what’s up”

Kaprint(“Message”)

}
}

## Code meaning
The class is established using the declare keyword, with the name of the class "Main". A static object is passed which does not modify the argument and allows the message, "what's up", to be shown in String format.
