# Hidden Movement

Hidden Movement is a theory which provides the dataset routinely moves around in distinct pathways to determine the readability and accuracy of in basketball. These are often deployed to predict the rate of such elements from the game and the rate it can produce such events

## Example code

import random

-- Define possible basketball events -- 
events = ["shot_made", "shot_missed", "pass_success", "pass_fail", "turnover"]

            self.dataset.append((event, pathway))
            self.pathways.append(pathway)
